## Installing TrollInstallerX 

You can install TrollStore on your device in two different ways, depending on your device and iOS version.

### 1. Direct Installation

✅ iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices

❌ iOS 16.5.1, A15, A16, and M2

TrollInstallerX directly installs TrollStore and its helper without leaving the installer.

### 2. Indirect Installation

✅ iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 arm64e

✅ A15, A16 and M2

TrollInstallerX replaces a system app with the TrollStore helper using the [kfd kernal exploit](https://cydia2.com/kfd-jailbreak/). 

This method works on iOS 16.5.1 to 16.6.1 for arm64e devices.

## FAQs - TrollInstallerX 

### 1. Why am I stuck at "Exploiting kernel"?
   
This can happen with the kfd exploit. Simply restart your device and try again.

### 2. Why can't I open/see TrollStore after installation?
   
After installation, open your persistence helper and tap "refresh app registrations" to fix this issue.

### 3. Why didn't the app I selected become the persistence helper?
   
If your selected app didn't change, you might already have a persistence helper installed. Check TrollStore settings for the current one.

### 4. Why do I get an error about patchfinding?

This might occur if you're offline or using certain device versions.

### 5. Why does TrollInstallerX say "failed to install persistence helper" with the indirect method?
   
Sometimes, the indirect method fails. Restart your device and try again. If the issue persists, try another app.

### 6. Why doesn't TrollInstallerX support iOS 17.0?

There are no public exploits for iOS 17.0 yet. Once available, they'll be integrated into TrollInstallerX.
