## Installing TrollInstallerX 

You can install TrollStore on your device in two different ways, depending on your device and iOS version.

### 1. Direct Installation

‚úÖ iOS 15.2+ arm64e devices
‚ùå iOS 16.5.1, A15, A16, and M2

TrollInstallerX directly installs TrollStore and its helper without leaving the installer.

### 2. Indirect Installation

‚úÖ iOS 16.5.1 - 16.6.1 arm64e
‚úÖ A15, A16 and M2

TrollInstallerX replaces a system app with the TrollStore helper using the kfd kernel exploit. 

This method works on iOS 16.5.1 to 16.6.1 for arm64e devices.
